<body>You are now in front of the SHSID swimming pool.&nbsp; Until it

building that served as a billet for internee families with

menu.<br><br><img style="width: 453px; height: 328px;" src="img/cac_bldg_desc_Button5a.jpg" alt=""><br><img style="width: 438px; height: 328px;" src="img/cac_bldg_desc_Button5b.jpg" alt=""><br><br><img style="width: 416px; height: 312px;" src="img/cac_bldg_desc_Button5c.jpg" alt=""></body></html>
