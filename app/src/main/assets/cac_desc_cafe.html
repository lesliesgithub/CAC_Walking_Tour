You should now be standing in front of the entrance to SHSID No.1
Cafeteria.&nbsp; Everyday internees would line up with their ration
cards to receive their meals.&nbsp; Three times a day, later only
two, they would get a plate of stewed cracked wheat or red cargo rice
topped with whatever meat or vegetables had been delivered by the
Japanese or the Swiss Red Cross.&nbsp; Meals were prepared by
internee work crews in two cookhouses adjacent to the cafeteria, now
demolished.<br><br>

The rice was of lowest quality so it had to be sifted grain by grain by
the crews to remove debris and bugs.&nbsp; One unknown internee
wrote a poem on the subject: <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;We got burned rice, that wasn&#8217;t rice,
like bits of festered cinders, we got boiled rice, quite spoiled rice
]and kerosene drum oiled rice.<br><br><img style="width: 463px; height: 265px;" src="img/cac_bldg_desc_Button3c.jpg" alt=""><br>

Red Cross food parcels were a lifeline.&nbsp; Sent by neutral
friends or Chinese company staff in Shanghai, these boxes of canned and
dried food kept many from lapsing into malnutrition.&nbsp; Extra
rations would be heated on individual home-made stoves called
&#8216;chatties,&#8217; which also doubled as personal heaters in winter.<br>
